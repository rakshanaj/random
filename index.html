            <div id="about">
            <p >I'm currently a senior (4th year student) at <a href="https://www.amrita.edu/campus/bengaluru" target="_blank">Amrita School of Engineering</a>, Bangalore. I am someone who tries to implement solutions to real world problems using technology or even a fun app as a surprise birthday present for a friend!
                I've worked on multiple projects with different teams and gained huge amounts of experience and knowledge from each. I've dived into Web Developement, App Developement, Machine Learning concepts and Cloud computing in the past four years.
                I hope to learn and gain exposure in more upcoming technologies and explore each by building relevant products.

                <p >From my life experiences and the projects I have worked on, I have learnt a great deal. I have 
                    worked with multiple teams and have had the opportunity to be the scrum master for one of them where I could successfully 
                    lead my team to a provide a satisfactory product.
                    My eagerness to learn and better myself ensures to keep myself updated with the new and upcoming technologies in my domain. On multiple occassions
                    I could see how quick a learner I am, when I was excited about exploring a new technology. 
                    Working as the Joint Secretary of the computer science club enabled me to think quick on my feet and provided me with good team building practices and interactions with peers that broadened my skillset.
